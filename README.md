# nicknacks

Nicknacks is a collection of JavaScript helper and utility functions that I've found myself using repeatedly. Generally, they're somewhat more specialized than what might be included in [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) or [Lodash](https://lodash.com/), although there's bound to be some overlap.
